## You've never seen a CMS so simple with Symfony.

Simple Page+Category system. Deep urls.

```
/pages/
/pages/home
/pages/home/about
/pages/team
/pages/team/devs
```

Zero layout = 100% flexible template.

Layout based on URI pattern = 100% customized layout. Ready-to-plug to Javier Eguiluz's EasyAdminBundle admin backend
with a simple code explained in the documentation. !
